# Frontend Mentor - Coding bootcamp testimonials slider

![Design preview for the Coding bootcamp testimonials slider coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my take on the Frontend mentor challenge (coding-bootcamp-testimonials-slider-master).

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this testimonial slider and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
